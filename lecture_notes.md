# PSYCH 350

## Lecture 1 - Sept 9

White males are more drawn to Trump because they have seen their social status decline. 

Clinton's unfavourables are really high.

Rob Ford has some similarities to Trump. Populist message and an appeal to demographics that are disenfranchised. 

Beyond North America, Brexit - very polarizing campaign. Also threatening minorities. Ethnic threat is a clear message coming through.

Black Lives Matter movement and political cause adovocating for reform.

Why do individuals vote? People turn out even if it's dangerous, or there are repercussions. People also fight for their right to vote.

Why is it a paradox? It doesn't seem that any individual should have rational reason to vote. The decision to vote is based on the equation `p(benefits) > (costs)`. The probability that your vote will have an influence on the election. 2 problems:

- very rarely are individual votes decisive. so the probability that your vote _matters_ is small
- benefits are public goods available to both voters and non-voters. (eg. your party wins but you didn't vote for it).

Consequently `p(benefits) < (costs)`. 

People get utility from the act of voting, expressing their preference.

Civic motivation.

What makes some leaders exceptional?

What is political charisma? Perceiving the politician as being representative of your group and putting your needs first.

## Lecture 2 - Sept 11

Essay due mid to late november. 5-6 page paper.

Equity theory - is there a proportional relationship between the inputs and outputs that people experience. If the ratio is perceived to be inbalanced, then people will be distressed (inequity aversion, IA). Motivation to restore equity to alleviate the distress. Can also be experienced as anger/resentment if you get less (primary IA) or guilt if you receive more (secondary IA).

Primary IA is more robust than secondary. Both effects are reliable.

Can alleviate IA by altering the inputs or outcomes. (social action avenue - change the system)

Another way is to adjust perceptions of the situation. Make them seem more proportionate (illusion of equity).

There have been studies showing this. When there are exchanges offered, and one gets less than an other similarly situated party, the person that is being offered less tends to reject the offer, even if this is personally costly. 

When people make decisions about how to allocate resources, they generally act equitably rather than explotiing their power.

When outcomes aren't proportionate, they party with less outcome will tend to reduce their input. Those who receive more often tend to increase their inputs.

Even monkeys have a similar response to inequity. They would otherwise be happy to accept the cucumber, but not when another monkey gets a grape.

Do infants exhibit this as well? Infants watch puppet show. In one show the toys are distributed equitably, in the other, one puppet gets nothing. Experimenter observes how long infant looks at screen (viewing time is a common measure - look longer at things that violate expectations, eg. laws of physics).

They stare longer at the unequal condition. Children see unequal distribution as violating their expectations.

They ran another experiment where the puppets were not social actors. Two puppets never moved and never said yay or anything like that. Just background ficture in the scene. Had two conditions again: equal and unequal. This time, children looked at both the same, as their was no violation of expectation.

There was another control case where it didn't seem that the experimenter was causing the distribution. There was a cover on top of toys, experimenter would remove cover. No allocationg resources, just revealing the allocation. Same 2 different conditions. Again children looked at both the same.

Liberals should show lower happiness when social conditions are unequal. Conservatives tend to endorse views that rationalize inequality. Meritocratic ideology. Convince themselves that groups that earn less deserve to earn less (either because they work less or are less skilled). So inequity should be less disturbing to conservatives.

So when income inequality was higher, it had a depressing effect on happiness, more so on liberals than conservatives.

How erroneous foul calls affect NBA players' free throw scoring. Over a year, examined all NBA games and coded for foul calls by refs and the effects of those calls on the free throw success rate. Were looking for whether the ref made an error in calling the foul. If it's clear to the researcher that the foul was false, then the free throw shooter also knows this (assumption). Hypothesis: then player should be disturbed by having unearned advantage, and maybe ruins their shot. This ended up being true. 74% vs 53%. No negative impact on the second free throw shot.

Study also looked at when team is ahead or behind. 34% when team ahead, 67% when team behind/close game.

The depressed entitlement effect: when their are unequally positioned groups, disadvantaged people tend to believe they deserve less.

- men tend to be paid more, women tend to believe they deserve less. Women internalize belief that their work is inferior. Adjust their perception of their input downwards.
