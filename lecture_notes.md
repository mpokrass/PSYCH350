White males are more drawn to Trump because they have seen their social status decline. 

Clinton's unfavourables are really high.

Rob Ford has some similarities to Trump. Populist message and an appeal to demographics that are disenfranchised. 

Beyond North America, Brexit - very polarizing campaign. Also threatening minorities. Ethnic threat is a clear message coming through.

Black Lives Matter movement and political cause adovocating for reform.

Why do individuals vote? People turn out even if it's dangerous, or there are repercussions. People also fight for their right to vote.

Why is it a paradox? It doesn't seem that any individual should have rational reason to vote. The decision to vote is based on the equation `p(benefits) > (costs)`. The probability that your vote will have an influence on the election. 2 problems:

- very rarely are individual votes decisive. so the probability that your vote _matters_ is small
- benefits are public goods available to both voters and non-voters. (eg. your party wins but you didn't vote for it).

Consequently `p(benefits) < (costs)`. 

People get utility from the act of voting, expressing their preference.

Civic motivation.

What makes some leaders exceptional?

What is political charisma? Perceiving the politician as being representative of your group and putting your needs first.
