# PSYCH 350

## Lecture 1 - Sept 9

White males are more drawn to Trump because they have seen their social status decline. 

Clinton's unfavourables are really high.

Rob Ford has some similarities to Trump. Populist message and an appeal to demographics that are disenfranchised. 

Beyond North America, Brexit - very polarizing campaign. Also threatening minorities. Ethnic threat is a clear message coming through.

Black Lives Matter movement and political cause adovocating for reform.

Why do individuals vote? People turn out even if it's dangerous, or there are repercussions. People also fight for their right to vote.

Why is it a paradox? It doesn't seem that any individual should have rational reason to vote. The decision to vote is based on the equation `p(benefits) > (costs)`. The probability that your vote will have an influence on the election. 2 problems:

- very rarely are individual votes decisive. so the probability that your vote _matters_ is small
- benefits are public goods available to both voters and non-voters. (eg. your party wins but you didn't vote for it).

Consequently `p(benefits) < (costs)`. 

People get utility from the act of voting, expressing their preference.

Civic motivation.

What makes some leaders exceptional?

What is political charisma? Perceiving the politician as being representative of your group and putting your needs first.

## Lecture 2 - Sept 11

Essay due mid to late november. 5-6 page paper.

Equity theory - is there a proportional relationship between the inputs and outputs that people experience. If the ratio is perceived to be inbalanced, then people will be distressed (inequity aversion, IA). Motivation to restore equity to alleviate the distress. Can also be experienced as anger/resentment if you get less (primary IA) or guilt if you receive more (secondary IA).

Primary IA is more robust than secondary. Both effects are reliable.

Can alleviate IA by altering the inputs or outcomes. (social action avenue - change the system)

Another way is to adjust perceptions of the situation. Make them seem more proportionate (illusion of equity).

There have been studies showing this. When there are exchanges offered, and one gets less than an other similarly situated party, the person that is being offered less tends to reject the offer, even if this is personally costly. 

When people make decisions about how to allocate resources, they generally act equitably rather than explotiing their power.

When outcomes aren't proportionate, they party with less outcome will tend to reduce their input. Those who receive more often tend to increase their inputs.

Even monkeys have a similar response to inequity. They would otherwise be happy to accept the cucumber, but not when another monkey gets a grape.

Do infants exhibit this as well? Infants watch puppet show. In one show the toys are distributed equitably, in the other, one puppet gets nothing. Experimenter observes how long infant looks at screen (viewing time is a common measure - look longer at things that violate expectations, eg. laws of physics).

They stare longer at the unequal condition. Children see unequal distribution as violating their expectations.

They ran another experiment where the puppets were not social actors. Two puppets never moved and never said yay or anything like that. Just background ficture in the scene. Had two conditions again: equal and unequal. This time, children looked at both the same, as their was no violation of expectation.

There was another control case where it didn't seem that the experimenter was causing the distribution. There was a cover on top of toys, experimenter would remove cover. No allocationg resources, just revealing the allocation. Same 2 different conditions. Again children looked at both the same.

Liberals should show lower happiness when social conditions are unequal. Conservatives tend to endorse views that rationalize inequality. Meritocratic ideology. Convince themselves that groups that earn less deserve to earn less (either because they work less or are less skilled). So inequity should be less disturbing to conservatives.

So when income inequality was higher, it had a depressing effect on happiness, more so on liberals than conservatives.

How erroneous foul calls affect NBA players' free throw scoring. Over a year, examined all NBA games and coded for foul calls by refs and the effects of those calls on the free throw success rate. Were looking for whether the ref made an error in calling the foul. If it's clear to the researcher that the foul was false, then the free throw shooter also knows this (assumption). Hypothesis: then player should be disturbed by having unearned advantage, and maybe ruins their shot. This ended up being true. 74% vs 53%. No negative impact on the second free throw shot.

Study also looked at when team is ahead or behind. 34% when team ahead, 67% when team behind/close game.

The depressed entitlement effect: when their are unequally positioned groups, disadvantaged people tend to believe they deserve less.

- men tend to be paid more, women tend to believe they deserve less. Women internalize belief that their work is inferior. Adjust their perception of their input downwards.

## Lecture 3 - Sept 14

Meritocracy isn't the only principle of distributive justice, we also apply equality/egalitarianism. Eg. right to vote. Or allocation based on need, eg. communal sharing.

Procedural justice as a determinant of the procedural legitimacy of the outcome. People care about the quality of procedures that yielded an outcome. We care about fair treatment in the procedures because fairness of the procedures is a signal that the decision makers respect us. This satisfies us with the process. Need to see that their interests/positions were paid attention to. 

Even if the ultimate outcome isn't in agreement with one's interests, if the process is fair, they will be satisfied. Will view the decision as legitimate. Voice effect - voice has some role.

Why do people care about the fairness of the procedure? Because the quality of the procedure conveys info about one's status within the group. Group tie to the authority figure. 

Study with quality of outcome and fairness (grading). People cared more about quality of process rather than outcome. However fairness of treatment didn't matter as much for outgroup authorities. Thus the factors were quality of treatment for ingroup tie and quality of outcome when no shared ingroup tie.

Trump: "I alone can fix these problems". Model of leadership where one exceptional leader has the required qualities. 

Elections are often about different models of leadership.

Obama at the democratic convention a week later: Trump isn't actually offering issues - he's just offering fear/slogans. He thinks that scaring people may win him the election. He believes in the constituion, that the people together can form a more perfect union. Americans want a leader that will mobilize the people to attain change together, mobilize collective efforts. 

"great person" models - effective leaders have essential traits/abilities

interactionist models - traits that determine leadership success depend upon fit with the task/challenge

social identity model - leaders are successful to the extent that they embody qualities that represent the particular groups they lead.

Obama uses more of a social identity model. He says that americans don't subscribe to the great person model because it doesn't fit american values.

Leader success: do they match the values of the group + do they signal that they will be looking out for the group, prioritizing the group's interest. 

Leaders can increase their effectiveness by being identity "entrepreneurs". Change the way that people perceive either their group or the leader. 

- try to enhance the group's sense of identity (in-group)
- change impressions of themselves to improve the match with in-group prototype

Studies where people manipulate profiles of leaders. Those who match more closely are perceived to be more effective and charismatic.

When leaders match the group more, this is a stronger predictor of effectiveness than assertiveness, stereotypical characteristics. 

Stanford prison experiment. Conclusions that researchers were suspicious of. 

## Lecture 4 - Sept 16

One of the prisoners would be selected by one of the guards to be promoted to a guard. 

When social identities have permeable boundaries, people have less commitment to these identities. So this mitigates prisoners developing shared identity.

Then phase 2: promoted someone, then group identities were fixed. 

Phase 3: new prisoner introduced (expert union negotiator). Wanted to introduce someone with expertise that might frame the situation differently.

Phase 4: negotiator is removed

He didn't know that he was recruited with that in mind, wasn't given any special instructions. 

Initially guards were ambivalent about their roles. Prisoners also weren't cohesive. Were compliant with guards. Scientists thought that guards would have a stronger feel for their role, but they did not. 

Following the promotion (stage 2) prisoners started to act together, and guards banded together. 

Negotiator encouraged both guards and prisoners to rethink their identities. Changed it from us vs them, to workers vs management. Guards and prisoners were employees of the BBC. 

An opportunity: guard leaves keys behind and a prisoner steals them. This causes a crisis. This gave prisoners levarage. This guy wants to use them to make demands.

The negotiator said instead they should all meet (guards + prisoners) every day to raise greivances. (DM is negotiator). DMs idea prevails. Original prisoner said that he didn't want to, wants to use it more immediately. DM won the argument. Presented himself as a representative of the prisoners. Embodies this role as spokesperson for the prisoners. Leadership fails to emerge among guards. 

Prisoners group identity increased as time went on. 

Then DM leaves and prisoners rebel. Staged a breakout form prison. Occupied the guard's quarters (sit-in). Forced the guards to engage in negotiations. Suggested abandoning the former structure: rebrand as a commune, all work together. 

Dissent emerged among the prisoner group.

Eventually the communal vision collapsed (and bad food). Change in people's views about the nature of leadership. More preference to authoritarian model.

## Lecture 5 - Sept 19

A group can get inspired to a leader and get committed to that leader. But if it doesn't translate to effectiveness, they become disheartened/discouraged. This causes a vaccuum and often leads to a more traditional view of leadership - imposing one's views on the world. We can see these in Trump. Giving praise to Putin, etc. 

Build a wall - make Mexico pay for it; imposing his will. All of his deals are coercive negotiation tactic, not common ground. Very leader-focused model, not follower-focused. His success may be due to similar processes as in the prison experiments. When collectivism doesn't work, people sometimes turn to leader based. 

-
For democracy to succeed, individuals need to do their part. Citizens need to be active, otherwise democracy can't succeed. Citizens need to pay taxed and vote. For a thriving democracy, citizens should be engaged in political life. Should voice their concerns/interests. 

The costs involved in voting seem to outweigh any individual benefit. Trying to understand the motivations that inspire people to vote. 

Endorsing the view that voting is a citizen's duty is positively associated with likelihood of voting in elections. Individuals with ties to people who vote are more likely to vote. 

People report voting significantly more than they actually do. If acts of civic engagement are motivated by social norms, this primes this civic duty and increases motivation to vote. Can make this normative pressure higher by monitoring people. Exposing people to public scrutiny. 

-
Study during election in Michigan, with low voter turnout.  2006 primary in Michigan. Identified 180k households. Randomly assigned each household to either control or 1 of 4 treatment conditions. These varied in level of social pressure. 

People were mailed a voter turnout message 11 days before election. Messages varied in their content. 

1. minimum social pressure, just a reminder. `Do your civic duty and vote`. Just priming.
2. Ramp up the normative pressure. Made them aware that they are being studied. 
3. `Who votes is public information.` Will send follow-up mail saying whether you voted or not. 
4. Everyone in your neighbourhood will see who voted or not. Showed who voted in previous elections in this prelim notice. 

Effects:

1. Increased turnout by 1.8%
2. Increased by 2.5%
3. 4.8%
4. 8.1%

-
Does the quality of normative feedback matter?

One way is positive feedback when behaviour complies with social norms.

Also negative feedback when norm is violated.

Negative messages tend to be more effective. However extreme negative feedback that is stigmatizing and threatens self-esteem tends to backfire and further decrease performance. 

Another study, 3 conditions:

1. civic duty
2. It's your civic duty to vote, track how you vote and give feedback
3. Shame condition: not positive if did vote, negative information for when you didn't vote. Will get more follow up mail if doesn't vote again.

Results:

1. 1.8%
2. 4%
3. 6.3%

-
Voter turnout among young people is declining. Older voters believe it's a civic duty more. The normative climate that people are growing up in now doesn't impose this notion of civic duty. 

## Lecture 6 - Sept 21

Voters need to judge complex issues. 

- gov't handling of public issues
- express opinions about priority ranking of public issues
- understand and evaluate candidates' proposed policies

Crime in Canada has been declining over time. But people kept thinking otherwise. Think that there was an urgent need for reform. 

Justice minister replied saying "we don't govern on the basis of statistics"

Canadian citizens thought that sentencing was "too lenient". Supreme court struck down mandatory minimums. Canadian's mostly agreed with supreme court, but not with mandatory minimum judgement.

Most people think that crime rates have been increasing, even though that's not true. The media has a role to play in this effect. Also people judge based on emotional reactions, and recency effects. Also availability bias. "How easy is it for me to think of a case of crime?"

-
Inferential heuristics: we perform natural/easy judgements to avoid critical thinking.

Eg. affective (like vs dislike) judgements, resemblence, ease of processing.

Other judgements are harder for us to grasp.

Eg. probability of success of policy initiatives, quality of gov't handling of crime, economy.

When people are confronted by non-intuitive judgements, they often sub in an answer to a related intuitive judgement. 

People overestimate terror attacks in usa, and overestimate sars in canada. Because these are more relevant in these places. SARS entered in Toronto. Salience of media coverage and public attention affects availability heuristic. 

The feeling heuristic: rely on feelings they experience as they think about the topic. Also have transient feelings that affect our broader issues, eg. bad day. 

Voting decisions heavily affected by whether or not local sports team had recently won. The effect gets bigger if the team is really popular. More likely to support the incumbent. 

Asking people about obama after their team winning in march madness made them like obama more.
Asking people about march madness before asking about obama made mitigated this effect. Merely asking this question eliminated outcome. Allowed them to get insight into their feelings. 

Fluency heuristic: people use it to estimate the plausibility/importance of an outcome based on the ease they experience imagining that otcome. This can be bad when familiarity is not always ecologically valid as a cue to the plausibility/importance. Eg. global warming - today is cold though. 

## Lecture 7 - Sept 23

In the marketplace of ideas, higher quality ideas will spread and win out. 

When we encounter an idea, we evaluate it in a neutral stance. We have the ability to comprehend information in an agnostic way. This is the cartesian view.

Spinoza said that in the moment of comprehenstion, we have to initially entertain it as being true. It's not an agnostic stance, it's a credulous stance. We can of course eventually reject it, but to comprehend it we must initially believe it. When our ability to attend/process the information might be under stress, or we are distraced, then we are more vulnerable to believing untruthful things, because we have diminished ability. Don't apply/maintain the false tag to the thought. 

Some evidence that Spinoza has a more accurate view. There is evidence for passive acceptance. 

Developmental evidence: hyper-suggestability of children.

Psychological evidence: sleep deprivation and susceptability to propoganda. 

So how should we go about debunking bad ideas? In election campaigns there are often false statements being made. 

-
Study, CDC pamphlet saying facts and myths about vaccines.  Studied how many false beliefs people remembered: myths misremembered as true and facts misremembered as false. 

Immediately: 4% misremembered facts as false and myths as true.

In delayed recall: much more myths misidentified as true. The other errors did not go up. (seems to confirm spinozan model)

False-ness tag is fragile, and now the myth has a ring of familiarity to it, so when you reconsider it it seems fluent and easy to process - lends it a sense of credibility. 

Paradoxical implication - when there are false ideas, may be better off not doing fact-checking campaigns and repeating the claims, tagging them as false. 

-
Some argue that emotions engage our interests/motivations. Without emotional judgements we would be overwhelmed by information. This helps us prioritize and identify important stimuli. 

Civil rights movement - campaign in Alabama, peaceful protest march. Only when emotionally charged images/videos were released did it galvanize the public. 

3yr old boy who was found face down drowned during Syrian refugee crisis. Trudeau used this as ammunition, because he was running of a platform on accepting refugees. Harper gov't was on weaker position because of this. 

-
How should we value lives? two normative models of compassion

If we believe that every human life is equally valuable, we shoud scale our emotional response based on the number of people involved. 

If we believe that mass tragedies are especially damaging to the social fabric, we should care more when a crisis meets a critical mass. Exponential once it hits this point. 

Psychophysical law: sensitivity to changes in stimulus value decrease as stimulus magnitude increases. Logarithmic difference. 

"A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic" - Stalin. We are more affected by things that are closer to us. 

-
Study:

condition 1: info on statistics

condition 2: particpants received info about single child

condition 3: both 1 and 2

Predicted that 1 would be less engaging. 

Donated most in condition 1, next condition 3, then condition 2. Suggests that when we consider something as being broader in scope, it reduces our emotional response. 

## Lecture 8 - Sept 26

We downregulate emotional response as scope becomes more significant. 

How many victims must there be before it reduces our emotional response?

single victim: either Rokia or Moussa (g vs b)

two victims: info on both.

Much more emotionally responsive when 1 victim than 2. Also reduced level of generosity towards the victims. When you present >1 it pulls out people's emotional involvement. 

Attention to any particular victim gets diluted.

Pseudo-inefficacy: negative feelings about not being able to help other victims diminish warm glow about help one can give. 

-
Manipulation of victim relatedness.

If individual stories are very compelling, maybe there is a way to represent a collective group of victims as one concrete unit. Makes them into one coherent narrative. Maybe this will give the same level of emotional responsiveness. 

IV: one victim vs eight victims related vs eight victims unrelated

DV: how much people care

Eight related is a singular coherent story, increases emotional responsiveness, when compared to unrelated. 

Seen in emotional response and in amount of charitable response. 

-
Motivated reasoning and opinion polarization

People are biased, first to seek out evidence that agrees with their point of view. People are biased to avoid inconvenient facts. Biased information seeking. 

Biased in how we interpret information we are exposed to. 

People are biased to accept arguments that confirm their existing beliefs and discount arguments that contradict their existing beliefs. 

Asymmetrical skepticism. 

With so many different media outlets, we are more likely of self-selecting media that agrees with our views. This contributes to the polarization of society. Exposure to idealogically-consistent information. 

We may see a fractioning of society into hardened factions. 

-
Study examining web links

Do people link to stuff more that shares their ideological leanings?

Coded websites as conservative/liberal leaning, and content of links.

100% of conservative websites had at least one link to another conservative site. Strongly linked with allies. Less than 20% of sites had a link to a liberal POV.

Liberal sites had 92.8% vs 42.8%

Hate groups had this even more pronounced effect. 

Amazon book buying clusters, less likely to read opposing view books.

-
Analyze tweets of Canadians in 2011 election. Analyzed their tweets to find their views. Checked who they tweeted most with.

Conservatives talk to each other a lot, but less to other parties. Observed connections vs expected connections. 

Much more likely to exchange tweets with people in your party. 

## Lecture 9 - Sept 28

Trump is using some evidence saying that he won the debate, so is Clinton. 

Each group thought that their candidate one. Independents thought Clinton won more though. Confirmation bias.

Biased screening of information. 

-
Recruited a sample of participants, pre-screened to see if in favour of gun control or not.

Read 16 different arguments, 4 different sources, 4 each (eg. republican, democratic, nra). Allowed people to read 8 arguments, no constraints on which ones they wanted.

they decided themselves which sources to pursue information from.

After that, summarize info to another student. Thinking was that they would want best info to present relevant and thoughtful commentary.

Predicted that despite the motivation to be thoughtful, people would be motivated by biases to seek out confirming information.

All arguments actually from the sources. Sample argument: futility argument. 

Also measured participants' levels of political sophistication. Eg. who their senator is, supreme court dealings.

Identify well-informed citizens vs ignorant. To identify where the motivated bias is more strong. Thinking that sophistication allows them to guide information better and sustain their bias - stronger motivated bias. 

Bias in both cases. Pattern of bias is stronger in high information voters. 

-
We are credulous towards arguments that fit our beliefs, and skeptical of arguments that are conradictory. 

Eg. Trump birther theory. 

You'd think they'd be a skeptical group, but they believed very iffy behaviour that agreed with their thoughts. Non-skeptical towards stuff they want to believe. 

High political knowledge people had more rejecting thoughts for opposing info. 

Maybe high political knowledge people have already thought about these arguments, and aren't rejecting them out of bias. 

Confirmation biases with motivated sources can add to further polarization of voters, and judgements of political issues. 

Getting to know people on the other side of the issue. Basically getting to know them as a person first, and then realizing their beliefs. Opens people up to more constructive dialog. 

-
Conceptualizes attitudes as stored evaluations that a person retrieves and reports (file drawer assumption, traditional).

## Lecture 9 - Sept 30

Opinion surverys are a source of information about what the public wants. Tendency to presume that there are preexisting attitudes and opinion surverys merely reveal these attitudes to us.

What might be misguided about this is that there is research that survey questions often lead to the construction of an attitude. Attitudes are constructed in the context in which they are being expressed.

Queues from the context can be used to disambiguate what the question is about.

Relatively superficial changes in question wording can lead to dramatic response changes.

Eg. spending too little on "assistance to the poor" vs "welfare". 65% vs 20%

Welfare has often been used as a symbol of overspending, laziness. This phrasing brings to mind negative associations. 

Eg. Support for "gays and lesbians" serving in the military - 51%. Support for "homosexuals" serving in the military - 34%. 

Outsider term. Might also be because most animosity is towards gay men, but reminding them of women lessens this. 

-
Psychological influences on responses to public opinion surveys.

1. conversational norms: when questions are ambiguous, respondents use other cues in the conversational context to disambiguate meaning.

2. Consistency pressures: respondents are motivated to seem consistent in their pattern of responses across survey items
3. Motivation to create a good impression

-
Conversational norms:

- survey respondents assume that surver designers expect them to be able to answer the questions they pose.
- do they have a "don't know" option?

Consistency

- first vs second question (affirmative action for women vs minorities, stick to their first answer)

Good impression

- Save face that voted when didn't 
- options to help people save face

-
Example of problematic media frame: false balance. Giving equal time to both sides, when both sides are not as legitimate. Well-intentioned on side of journalists. 

People have a difficult time discounting evidence even if they're told it's from an unrepresentative source. 

## Lecture 10 - Oct 3

Defining propaganda: persuasion tactics that exploit common psychological biases to influence the public's attitudes, rather thean persuading the public based on the intellectual merits of the arguments. Propaganda techniques work best for low involvement audiences. 

Other type is merits of the argument driving persuasion.

Central route: persuasion is based on careful consideration of strengths and weaknesses of the argurments. Strong arguments should promote thoughts consistent with the message position. Weak arguments should promote counter-arguing (inconsistent thoughts)

Peripheral route: support for message based on superficial cues (eg. prestige, number of arguments). When we're not as strongly engaged. 

route depends on recipient's motivation and ability to process the message. 

-
Strategies of low involvement persuasion (propaganda)

- simplicity
  - if simple messages are more politically persuasive, then their public speech should exhibit low complexity when seeking office, and high complexity when in office (hypothesis)
  - "campaign in poetry and govern in prose"
  - integrative complexity: two interraleted factors:
     - differentiation: number of different dimensions of a problem taken into account
     - integration: degree to which complex connections are made between the dimensions of a problem
     - code these and tell between seeking office and when in office
   - turns out to be true, higher integrative complexity when in office than when seeking office (except Hoover, great depression)
- repitition with variation
  - preference for the familiar: mere exposure effect
  - study with amount of exposure and what attitudes resulted
  - increased exposure elevates levels of persuasion
  - hyper-exposure might have the opposite effect however (reactives)
- fluency heuristic
  - people use the ease with which an idea is comprehended as a cue for judging its validity
  - eg. slogans, catchphrases, rhyming, color schemes
  - perceptually easy to process/digest message
  - hypothesis: ideas easier to believe when attractive
    - eg. woes unite foes vs woes unite enemies
    - used rhyming/catchy phrases and kept the message, but made it no longer catchy
    - same idea, just less catchy
    - then common idioms that didn't rhyme initially, also maintained the intent but modified words
    - result rhyming phrases were more "accurate", and modified to non rhyming were less "accurate"
    - those that were originally non rhyming were less "accurate" than when altered
    - Taking away catchiness removes salience
    - gave another group of participants a warning about catchiness, base only on claim, not poetic wording
    - this removed the biases
- social consensus heuristic
- stereotyping

## Lecture 11 - Oct 5

Social consensus heiristic

People use the apparent level of social support for an idea to decide whether they should support it

Social consensus influences persuasion through 2 mechanisms:

- informational influence: people assume that ideas that are popular must have more merit
- conformity pressure: people fear that they will be socially sanctioned if they do not endorse popular ideas

Audience reaction influences effectiveness of soundbites in Raegan's campaign.

Politicians can implicity activate stereotypes. Called dog-whistle politics. Racist message is one that only the racist audience can pick up on. Other audiences will be deaf to it. Coded signals that will target the people with biases/prejudices.

Eg. Willie Nelson "weekend pass" ad.

Anti black stereotypes correlated with how they enjoyed steretoype reinforcing ad.

Resistance to propaganda:

- forewarning
- attitude innoculation
- promoting greater political involvement
- policies: 
  - requiring political advertisements to disclose source at start of message rather than following message
  - format of political debates: audiences are instructed to not audibly respond to candidates

-
Psychological foundations of ideology

## Lecture 12 - Oct 14

Hypothesis: men who are prone to committing sexual harassment have a chronically accessible tendency to link power to sex.

Prime (subliminal) and target words.

Some primes were power related words (authority, strong) and ambiguous sex words (bed, motel) and some neutral words (clock, house)

Measure: response facilitation scores for trials on which power was the prime and sex was the target. Higher scores suggest greater reponse facilitation for a given prime-target combination, quicker to respond. 

Cross study, P->S and S->p and low likelihood to sexually harass, and high likelihood.

Result: men who are more likely to sexually harass have a very high link of P->S, but not S->P. Cues of power stir up thoughts of sex.

-
Another study. Measure male particpants' propensity to commit sexual harassment.

IV: prime participants with either power related words or neutral words. Eg. \_\_NTROL vs SAL\_D

IV: more likely or not to sexually harass

DV: rated the female experimenter on a number of dimensions including attractiveness

High propensity were signifcantly more likely to report attraction if they were primed with power vs neutral.

Low propensity had no signifanct differences based on primes.

Compelling evidence that some men might be more motivated to sexually harass women based on power. 

-
Motivation to reduce uncertainty/threat -> preference for order/stability -> poltical conservatism

The magnitude of difference in motivation to reduce uncertainty may be a big factor in political ideologies. 

IV: conservative vs liveral

IV: threatening vs neutral images

DV: change in skin conductance

Conservatives had highest change when showed threatening images. (apolitical threatening images)

-
IV: conservative vs liberal

DV: mean eyeblink amplitude

Conservatives have a more intense eyeblink reaction when harsh threatening noise.

-
Personalizing politics: How political ideology shapes autobiographical narratives

Partipants: actively religuous adults living in Chicago area.

Measures political ideology of each participant. Self placement on political ideolog scale. 

- political orientation
- right-wing authoritarianism (RWA): eg. obedience and respect for authority are more important
- social dominance orientation (SDO): eg. some groups of people are simply inferior to other groups

Participants completed life history interview, describing 12 scenes from their lives including high points, low poiints, turning points, etc

Interviews coded for narrative themes, including

- self regulation themes: protaganist strives to protect/preserve/control/regulate/manage the self 
- self exploration themes: expanding and broadening the self

Hypothesis: conservatives should be more likely to have more self regulation themes, liberals should be more likely to have themes of self exploration. Related to openness to experience (liberals) and conscientiousness (conservatives).

Results were as expected. 

Bush talked about overcoming alcoholism, Obama talked about finding himself.

-
Justifying the system: motivational roots and psychological consequences of rationalizing the status quo.

People earning <5k a year shows highest support belief that differences in income are required to get people to work hard. People who are really disadvantaged go out of their way to rationalize/defend it. 

-
Jost's system justification theory

- A fundamental motive to support, defend, and bolster status quo social arrangements
- people are motivated to approve of social arrangments even if those arrangements were arrived at arbitrarily or unjustly
- this motivation is activated when the system is threatened by either challenging its legitmacy or jeopardizing its security

Uncertainty aversion, fear of death, need for social identification lead to system justification. People are more affected by these factors based on personal characteristics. 

Hypothesis: the motivation to justify the system is activated by existential threats

Measure of threat: number of terror warnings, terror alert level

Gallup presidential approval tracking poll: do you approve of the way Bush is handling his job as president?

Result: signifcant increase in Bush's approval ratings based on number of terror alerts. Each terror warning boosted his approval by ~2.75%. Fear (existential) motivates people to be more supportive of the system. Think our leaders are better. 

## Oct 17

People don't protest very much, don't really hold people responsible. Sustained protest is abnormal. People are mostly disengaged. Inadequate explanation, because this does in fact occur sometimes, when the system is threatened. People are content with their system and think that it is for the best, at least better than the available alternatives. 

Fundamental motivation to see our sitautions as fair, legitimate. Go to lengths to defend/justify the system. Fundamental needs to avoid uncertainty, existential moviations (fear of death), and need for social identification. Existential - even though I die, the system may live on - symbolically defeat death.

Resistant to demands for change. Comes together to create a robust motivation to defent the system. Variability in motivation among people. Variability in underlying motives, some people are more averse to uncertainty than others. 

-
IV: participants write about the emotions they experince when thinking about their own mortality (existential threat) vs experiencing pain (control)

DV: preference for Bush (incumbent) vs Kerry (challenger) 

Result: pain prime - more Kerry (university students generally lean left)

Mortality - lean towards Bush. Want to feel secure in the current system. He's also a conservative, tend to defend structure and security. It isn't clear if Kerry was holding office if the incumbent effect or ideological effect is stronger. 

-
Palliative and pacifying functions. 

(These are predictions)

Palliative (personal):

- should be more likely to experience positive emotions, fewer negative emotions
- lower feelings of guilt/shame for high status groups (if system is just, then status is fair)
- for lower status group, less anger/frustation, getting just desserts
- heigtened subjective well being
- heightened motivation to puruse one's goals. Goal pursuit is risky, only do it if you think there is a likelihood of return, ie. if the system is fair. Particularly true of low status groups may especially need to perceive the system as fair to invest in long term goals. 

Pacifying (social):

- steretype high status groups as more deserving
- sterotype low status groups as less deserving
- resistance to social change (egalitarion redistribution)
- derogation of system critics

-
Trends in US: as income inequality increases over time, happiness decreases, but this is more pronounced for liberals. Negative relationship much stronger for liberals than conservatives. Conservatives more likely to see the system as just, this buffers their happiness when there are problems in society. 

-
Study regarding motivation to pursue personal goals. Members of low status should be more motivated to pursue these goals to the extent they believe the system is just. 

Relationships between socioeconomic status, fairness beliefs, and prioritization of work over leisure goals (how much you're willing to sacrifice for human capital). 

Result: when an individual didn't see society as far, low status groups really don't invest in goals. (what's the point of society isn't fair). Somewhat higher investment in medium status, and even higher in high status.

When groups perceive society as being fair: all of them invest more in work than leisure goals, but especially true in low status individuals. System justifying beliefs really bolster motivation in low status groups. Correlational study - not experimental. Could be a confounding factor.

Did an experimental study: ethnic majority and minority groups.

IV: partipants randomly assigned to read: 

- passage suggesting that conditions in Canada are fair OR
- control (something about toads)

DV: measure of their willingness to invest time and effort in pursuing long-term career goals

Prediction: minority Canadians motivation will be more contigent on information about societal fairness. 

Result: 

- Ethnic minority: reassurance in fairness boosted interest in investing in career goals
- majority: high investment in goals irrespective of what condition they're in. (Group status gives you advantages regardless of fairness)

-
Social consequences

Previous were personal consequences. 

We tend to stereotype groups to explain their social roles, unequal distribution.

Eg because men are overrepresented in agentic roles (Wage earners, management, leadership) and women are overrepresented in communal roles (child care, health care) that should motivate us to stereotype men as possesive more agentic traits (intelligence, self-control). We should stereotype women as possessing more communal traits (empathy). And this is generally what we observe.

Eg. there are ethnic groups that are worse off, we stereotype them as being lazy or less intelligent. 

-
Northern italians (high status) vs southern italians (low status).

Asked to attribute various traits to northern and southern italians.

DV: ingroup favouritism. 

DV: Also measured system justification beliefs. (1-9) 9 is more likely as seeing system as just and fair.

Reuslt:

- north: the more they see system as just and fair, more they see northern italians are better (escalating ingroup favouritism)
- south: reverse pattern. The more they see society as just, the less they favour their group. Lower ingroup favouritism (even goes negative, outgroup > ingroup favouritism). "If the society is just, my group must just be worse than the higher class."

-
Experimental study in Isreal. Israelis of European descent, ashkenazi (high status) vs middle eastern, sephardic (low status)

IV: endorsement for system justification. threat vs control

- passage that threatens how just they feel the system is  (should motivate defense of the system, more extremes) OR
- "despite some complaints, Israeli society is doing fine" (control)

DV: ingroup favouritism

Result:

- no system threat: both groups show moderate ingroup favouritism
- high system threat: ashkenazi jews show much higher ingroup favouritism, sephardic jews show much lower ingroup favouritism (higher outgroup than ingroup, negative value, undoing usual ingroup favouritism)

-
Examples of victim-blaming stereotypes in the aftermath of natural disasters

When we perceive groups as losing status, we often attribute negative traits to them (victim blaming). 

Eg. Hurricane Katrina during Bush's first term in office. Very poor disaster preparedness, some people were unable to evacuate. 

Conservative media personalities blamed victims of Katrina. Said that the blame lies on the victim's shoulders because of poor preparedness. 

Helps to explain why so many stereotypes of low status people are negative, so we can justify why they are of low status. 

-
This theory has a hard time explaining why some of the stereotypes are favourable. Eg. poor people are often stereotpyed as happier, more moral, and more sociable than rich people. How does system justification theory explain this?

Hypothesis: we gain system justifying effects by stereotyping low status individuals positively in some domains, if these domains are unrelated to success.

Doing so provides us a rationalization for that unequal distribution. Not hard work, intelligence, skills, motivation. These we attribute to high status groups. Not all domains are agentic.

In those (non agentic) domains, we give benefits to low status groups. Stereotype successful groups negatively in traits that are causally unrelated to success. Causes an overall balance in the society, low status people are earning something from their low status. 

## Oct 19

In order to maintain our belief in the system as fair and just, we stereotype successful people having traits related to success - rationalizes their status. Conversely, stereotype unsuccessful people as having other unrelated traits (happiness, sociable) - rationalizes as a fair system because they have other traits. 

Researches activates the system justification motive - exposed participants to information that threatened the system, then compared thier reactions with control group (no threats). 

Participants asked to rate powerful people on traits that were casually related to success, and causally irrelevant to success (eg. happiness). 

In low system threat, tendency to attribute intelligence to high power people, and not happiness. When you activate high system threat, increase in attribution of intelligence, decrease in attribution of happiness. Positive and negative stereotypes have complementary effects. 

Social consequences - reducing the perceived need to protest inequities. 

-
Study at protest rally in Athens; rallying against auserity legislation being considered by the gov't which included proposal to raise retirement age.

Participants exposed to a passage that either reinforced or contradicted stereotype that poor people happy. 

DV: 

- anger at the system
- support for disruptive protest

Result: after system justification beliefs, believe that poor are happy much more strongly, lowers their anger at the system. 

-
Negative evaluations of system critics

Participants reviewed a job interview where a European-American interview assessed an African-American interviewee, and decided to not hire. Also had racist notes for participant to read. 

Canditate attributed not being hired to 

- racism
- his own inadequate interview skills
- the quality of the competition

Participants got to see this (this was the IV). 

DV: "troublemaker" ratings of the job candidate. 

Result: in condition 1, rated as more of a troublemaker (because going against the system), even though his complaint was completely true. Less "troublemaker" ratings in conditions 2 and 3. 

-
Legitimizing ideologies (the example of benevolent sexism). 

When there is a persistent pattern of inequality between groups, we see a stereotype of values that justify the unequal status. This is called a legitimizing ideology. 

Eg. american dream, free market

-
Persistent gender inequalities

Women are underrepresented in positions of social power and authority and are often restricted from participating in activities that entail taking risks to achieve personal growth and status rewards.

Women tend to be overrepresented in caregiving work. 

-
Ambivalent Sexist ideology

The prevailing gender ideology in most cultures contains a mixtyre of benevolent sexist (BS) and hostile sexist (HS) attitudes

- BS is a patronizing ideology, stereotypes women as caring but childlike/incompetent. Idealizes women who conform to conventional feminine roles within the gender hierarchy, and offers protection and support for these women
- HS demonizes women who challenge traditional gender roles and threaten male privilege

Across many cultures, endorsement in BS tends to be positively correlated with endorsement of HS, and both forms of exism tend to be more strongly endorsed when gender equality is lower

Men endorse HS more than women. Women are more accepting of BS, sometimes endorse it as strongly (or more strongly) than men. 

BS functions to legitimize gender inequality. Might allow women to see the roles as fair; "complementary but equal". 

As the demand to justify social conditions in terms of equality has become more of a focus, the need to perceive unequal systems as having some kind of propensity or benefit to the low status person might increase.

Placing women on a pedestal may even mislead people to construe a system of male privelege as a system of female privelege. (if you only look at 1 element of the system)

Study

Participants read scale items ostensibly to evaluate their clairty for pilot testing purposes. 

IV: info in the scales

- benevolent sexist ideas (eg. purity)
- control (positive to women but not BS, eg. resourcefulness)

DV: measure of system justification. Eg. "everyone has a fair shot at wealth and happiness". Not gender specific in context. "Is the system you're in a fair one?"

Result: 

- control: men tend to see the system as fairer than women
- BS: women tend to see the system as fairer. Priming the BS ideas does away with grievances against the system.

-
German female students read statements ostensibly as part of an experiment on context-dependent memory

IV: Content of statements 

- BS prime (eg. men are incpmplete without women)
- HS prime (eg. when women have to work together, they often get into cat fights)
- control (eg. women are healthier than men). Positive about women but not connected to BS

DV: had opportunity to either read magazines or read literature about campaigns on campus (equity in gender equality campaign vs unrealted to gender)

DV: PErcentage of students who signed the petition, nubmer of flyers they took home. (all participants female)

Results:

- BS: significantly less motivated to support 
- HS: significantly more likely to support
- control: in the middle

Same pattern emerged in flyers. 

## Oct 21

Midterm: 10-12 MC, a few short answer

The dominant ideologies in a culture should rationalize system inequities. "Inequities are rational, inevitibly, even good"

Some patterns of inequality that are general - sexism. Negative depictions of women who violate gender norms (hostile sexism). Benovelent sexism works to encourage women to embrace their oppression. Lowers dissatisfaction with gender inequalities in society, lowers motivation to seek change. 

Campaign to recruit female professors to more senior positions on campus. Benevolent sexism prime - much less motivated to lend their support of furthering gender equality on campus. More likely to sign a control peition. Hostile sexism prime - most likely to sign equality petition. 

Same pattern when more concrete action - putting up flyers. HS > control > BS. 

-
BS ideology and iternalizing the male gaze

BS upholds certain women, a certain idealization, but from a masculine perspective. Aim to maintain high value in men's eyes. 

BS reminds women of their subordinate status to men. Self objectification focuses women's attention on apearance - not action - as an effective form of social currency. 

-
Manipulation of ideology priming

Pariticpants read scale items ostensibly to evaluate their clarity for pilot testing purposes

Content of scale items were varied to manipule the salience of BS ideology

IV:

- BS prime (eg. purity)
- HS prime (eg. women are too easily offended)
- control (positive idea of women that's not BS. eg. resourcefulness)

DV: measures of internalization of male gaze

Test self objectification (extend to which they considered appearance based qualities as more important than 5 general qualities). 

Also measured body shame ("When i'm not the size I think I should be, I feel ashamed")

Measured appearance management intentions. Thought listing task reflecting on plans/intentions for the rest of the week, coded for dieting, tanning, etc. 

Women most self objectifying when BS prime.

Women more self objectifying in general. 

Most body shame in BS prime in women. More appearance management for women in BS prime. 

-
Implications for social activism

Prediction: women's self objectiication should reduce their motivation to support gender equality

Manipulated the extent to which the women had self objectification thoughts. Had women consider situations in which they were objectified, or control, wrote about an unrelated domain. 

DV: 20 statements test, asked to answer 20 times in a row give a self description. "I am _____". Can code the content of what they fill in to see most relevant traits to self. Coded how much these were qualities of appearance. 

Measure: Reported intentions related to supporting gender equality issues. Measure of social activist motivation. 

Result: More likely to list qualities of body when filling in I am ___ statements. Also rated gender system as more fair and just when had reflected on objectified condition.

Significantly lower in their intention to participate in social activisim in the objectification condition. 

-
Mediation model: endorsement of system justification mediates the relationship between women's self objectification and reduced social activism. Vunerability to sexual objectification leading a reduction of women's role in social activism. 

-
Accepting the status quo: the motivational basis of political complacency. We are motivated to see the status quo as fair and just and rational. Tendency for us to see that the way things are is close to the ideal. 

Believing that the way things are is the way things ought to be. 

Conditions:

- status quo policy condition. Said that questioning subjects under stress was consistent with the status quo. Read about interrogation methods as if they were part of longstanding practices
- novel policy condition. referred to the same practices as if they were something new

DV: support for the practices

Much more support when status quo rather than new. Framing something as being part of the status quo seems to lend it credibility. Why is this?

- system escapability (i'm stuck in the system)
- system dependency

"All men, sooner or later, accomodate themselves to whatever becomes their circumstance"

Study:

IV: manipulated perceived escabability of the system. 

- low escapability: had participants read a passage showing Canada as a fixed system. "people wanting to leave Canada have a hard time doing so"
- high escapability: "increasingly easy for Canadians to migrate elsewhere"

- Status quo info. Amount of people on council that are high income. 

Measured status quo support measure. 

Result: Support of status quo higher for low escapability condition. More system critical when high escapability. 

-
Dependency on the system increases people's motivation to justify the system. 

IV: system dependency: federal policies significantly affect people's lives vs not

IV: status quo manipulation. Women 20% of Canadian MPs. Manipulated how this was portrayed. Scale from 0-100 vs scale from 0-25. 

DV: Measure of attitudes towards women in government eg. "to what extent do you believe that women should be in politics?"

Result: 

- high dependency: less support for women in gov't when status quo condition, more support when 0-25 scale.
- low dependency: regardlesss of condition, favourable views of women in gov't

Rationalize inequity in system dependency and low women condition (0-100)

## Review Session

Preceeding increase in terror threats saw subsequent increase in Bush ratings. He represented the current system, also is a conservative. Represents an ideology that aligns with safety and defense. 

-
Pro revolution statement attributed either to Jefferson or Lenin during the height of the cold war. Jefferson representative of the political revolution founding America. Americans positively view revolution in Jefferson's view. Revolution in terms of the Russian revolution, whom Lenin was the leader - is much more threatening to Americans. Replacement of a capitalist system with a radical system. The same sentence has different meaning depending on whom it is attributed to. 

Asked people what they thought the statement meant. Participants' attribution of statements varied based on author.

Sometimes when there is a difference of opinion on one idea, it may be because people interpret the idea differently, even if it is the same.

-
Fluency heuristic. The ease with which you call upon examples. We can use the meta-information on how hard it was, to judge how true/plausible/familiar/correct is the statement. We might perceive something easier to understand as more true as things that are more difficult to understand. Correctness is a difficult judgement to make. Making an easier answer takes less cognitive load. 

Feeling heuristic uses how I'm feeling right now to make other judgements - eg. how satisfied am I with my life/the direction this country is going. 

-
Implicit nationalistm - approach vs avoidance. Nations flag skewed people more towards the center. Become imbued with ideology, centrel tendencies of society. Make people embrace more central values. Right -> center, left -> center. 

Approach to center vs avoidance of the extreme. 

Priming with flag made people more racist. System justification theory in play as well. Priming flag -> defence of a nation -> racism towards black people, b/c they must be worse to justify our system. 

-
Two different ideas about how we assess the truth status of some concept or idea. Descartes had an idealized view of the mind. If we were designing it from scratch, we'd want it to assess ideas in an angostic way. First understand it, then commit to a truth value. Don't initially consider the truth value. Reserving judgement about the truth value unitl you've had time to assess its merits. First understand propositions or ideas that we are exposed to. Then tag it as true or false. Default representation is agnostic, neither true nor false. 

Spinosa had a different, more realistic view. Part of the process of understanding something involves initially accepting it as true. In order to understand it we should pull it in and accept it as true, and then evaluate it. Then, if we find flaws, we tag it as false. Default tag is true. If the default understanding of a belief is true, if we disconnect the false tag, we will see it as true. Naive credulity/tendency to accept what we're told as if it were true.

-
Control vs balance study

Basic idea is that when there's disagreement - two sides to an argument, news stories that cover tend to have a spokesperson from each side. Give equal coverage to both sides (even on issues like climate change, vaccines where the overwhelming consensus is in one direction). 

To test this, used an archival source of actual opinions on various issues. Some issues were skewed to one side, others had a more equal split. 

Either gave participants just the percentage breakdown of economists, or that and one representative argument on each side.

DV: asked how split economists are, is there enough consensus to inform policy or are they too split?

Result: poorer understanding of the split when there was an opinion on each side exposed. 

-
Trump article

Big 5 traits

Presidents usually higher agreableness, except Nixon. 

Circumstantial. Collection of what the field has learned about traits, and what we can guess as to Trump's traits and thus how he would lead. 

Schemas (social cognitive side), goals, pattern, style. Deal-making schema that Trump has. 

Trump's life story, how he sees it. 

What does this tell us about the way McAdams might use psychology to perform a case study. More from the lens of methodology. 

-
Paradox of voting

Voting is not effective from a cost benefit analysis (self interest), unless it gives value to self, social expectation/implications. Probability of my act of voting affecting something is really low. Enjoy the shared benefits regardless of whether you voted or not. 

-
Message telling people to vote, showing whether they had voted, previous track record, etc. Extrinsic motivation to appear as a more civically engaged citizen. Adding cost to not voting. 

-
Palliative effects are about how it influence's a person's emotions/feelings about themselves/society. Inequity aversion makes us feel negative emotions when we become aware of inequities or injustices. Reduces anger/resentment from disadvantage, also makes others feel better about their higher status. Palliative - helps resolve negative feelings regarding inequality. 

Passive effects - motivational consequences. When there's inequality, because of IA we should be motivated to reduce inequality. One of the key predictions of equity theory. Leads us to believe that one group is more deserving than another. Passive - reduces our motivation to take some action to correct the inequity. Convinces us that it's not inequity. 

## Oct 26

System dependency manipulation: high dependency on Canadian gov't vs not.

Status quo manipulation: made women's pop in gov't appear either large or small. (0-100 scale vs 0-20)

When perceived system dependency is high: support whatever they believe is the status quo. 

How can we motivate people to be open to reform in the system? How can we demonstrate that change is possible?

Vignette to read about guy who attempted to change the system (at OSU). Well positioned to seek change and did a lot of work to mobilize a demand to change. As a result, university drastically changed frosh program. Message that system is reformable. Says "change is possible"

In other condition told about the same guy, same postion, same grievances, tries to mobilize students but his efforts failed. Says "change is hard here but I still think it's possible"

Asked participants how much they thought the system was changeable. In high changeability condition rated system as more changeable. (duh)

Did that make students more critical of existing system? Yes it did, 45% vs 28% chose to look at a report on OSU system's weaknesses, or report on strengths. Adopted a more system-critical framework.

Thus suggesting that change is possible. 

-
Suggest that change is inevitible. People rationalize not the way things are, but the way they are about to be. 

Eg. Trudeau explaining his decision to appoint the country's first gender balanced cabinet. "Because it's 2015". There's a tide of change, that's the way things used to be. Not the way things will be done going forward. Simple but effective way of justifying it as inevitible. 

-
Told that expert group of political analysts. 

IV: strong likelihood of victory for one vs other vs ambiguous

- 51% al gore vs 43% bush
- 49% gore to 45% bush
- tie at 47%
- 49% bush to gore
- 51% bush to 43% gore

also studied republican vs democrat

DV: bush favourability ratings

result: favourability ratings of bush lowest in condition 1 (both democrats and republicans)

Democrats and repbuclicans more favourable of bush when in condition 5

Same results for gore

Inevitibility of result increases favourability. 

-
Convincing people that reform is necessary to protect the system: the system preservation frame. 

People generally think that defence of the environment is against the defence of the systems. If you can link defence of environment to perserving the system, can boost support.

All participants read a message that they are highly dependent on system.

Measured how strongly the participants were motivated to defend the system (system justification scale). 

IV: whether or not environmental reform was framed as preserving the system.

- yes: being pro environmental allows us to conserve the american way of life, it is patriotic
- control: same message but without system preservation part (above)

DV: measured attitudes towards environmental defence. Personal attitudes and behaviours. How many would sign pro environmental petition. 

Result: more system justification -> low environmental concern, with conrol

With new message (patriotism): high system justification -> high support for enivornmental reform.

Can take what is usually an impediment to reform (system justification) and leverage it to become an agent for reform.

-
The psychology of inequality

There are many factors that shape how much power a person experiences in their life.

- individual qualities: dominant seeking or power oriented, or body size (traditional systems/primates)
- ingroup variables: status you have within group
- between-group variables: social class, gender, ethnicity

These shape social power: resources/freedom gives high power. If less control over resources, more contraint over behaviour -> low power.

Psychological consequences: high power induces a psychology of approach, BAS. Strongly attended to rewards, highly reward seeking. Leads to egocentrism, self focused cognition. Disinhibited behaviour. Act as you feel, according to impulses and ignore usual norms and social constraints. 

Low power induces a threat motivated psychological system. Attention oriented towards threats and risks in environment. More externally focused, on others and their emotions/perceptions/attitudes. Context sensitive, restrained behaviour. Going to punished if don't conform, must attend to social norms more. 

This is a theoretical model. 

High power has a disinhibiting effect, then high power people should be more likely to violate social norms and moral rules.

-
Test of this hypothesis

Participants' subjective social class rank was experimentally manipulated. Have them compare themselves to either the highest ranked people or lowest ranked people in economic level of society. Comparing to high is a negative evaluation, makes you feel less powerful and vice versa.

Norm violation measure: participants left in a waiting area for the next part of the study. A jar of candies was present, told that they were for little children participating in a study. Measured how many of the candies the participants took. 

Result: High status people took signiificantly more candy than in low status condition. 

-
Field observation study looking at driver behaviour.

Cars are socioeconomic status indicators. 

Observed driver behaviour at a busy intersection, done in SF. 
Pedestrian confederate waiting at crosswalk, has right of way.

Coders positioned near crosswalk to make observations (out of sight):

- vehicle status: make, age, appearance
- driver characteristics: age, sex
- rule breaking: do the driver's yield right of way?

Result: Positive correlation between car status and rule breaking.

## Oct 28

High power people should be relatively less attuned to other people's emotions, beliefs, feelings. Lower power people must attend more to social contexts. 

-
Study

Power manipulation: recalled either low power or high power incident. 

Study of measure of egocentricm. Asked people to draw an E on their forehead. Either facing out or facing in. Egocentric people drew at their perspective, backwards to an observer. Coders coded how people wrote the Es. 

High power people drew egocentric E more than low power people. 

-
Tested emotional empathy

Manipulated subjective social class. Imagine ladder depecting people at different rungs of success in society, compare to highest rung (low status) or lowest rung (high status)

Empathy test - eye test, tell emitions form eyes. 

Upper status accuracy was lower than lower status. 

If you are made to feel more powerful - harder time understanding other people's emotions. 

-
Low people rients people to attend to social context, then they should show more compassion. 

Study charity giving. 

If income under 25k donate on average 4.2%, whereas high income (over 100k) donate on average 2.7%. correlational study

Also experimental study, engage with confederate on tasks. Real person had to complete a task that would either prime with compassion (video on poverty) or control (2 men talking in courtroom). 

Then confederate arrives, apologizes for being late, is distressed. Then told why. Told to assign tasks to confederate/self. Can assign her less tasks and more to yourself. Helpint measure = total number of minutes of task that the participants assigned to themselves. 

Neutral condition - low power gave more (low income) than high power (income). 

Compassion condition: equalizied giving among groups. 

Low power people gave the same amount regardles. 

It's important for us to ensure that high power people have moral values. 

-
the psychology of social movements

Key features of social movements:

- either challenge or defent status quo system
- collective rather than individual actions
- act outside official institiutional channels (but could still be supporting the traditional institutions of the system)
- relatively organized
- continuity of action (not just one day/event)

-
Classical social psychological accounts

Eg. frustration-aggression model

Structural strain -> disruptive psychological state -> social action

Strain: anything that may be a pressure that leads some people to experience less satisifaction relative to others. Eg. income inequality, underemployment

Disruptive psychological state: frustration

Social action: eg aggression against system, resolves tension

-
Archival analysis of lynching in the American south (extra-judicial killings, where civilians organize together to commit violence against other people in their community)

Would rate of lynchings tend to go up in years when the country was facing economic decline?

Did a time series analysis. Consistent with the hypothesis, more collective action when higher structural strain. 

-
"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore"

Built up tension/frustration vent it through emotional expression. When many people share this, they may endorse a collective expression of anger against the system. 

Sustained social movements are relatively rare. So is there little strain? are people complacent?

There is a difficulty in translating discontent to a movement. Maybe the venting can be expressed in different ways, eg joining cults, rather than political movements. 

Inaccurate and unflatttering portrayal of social activits as psychologically frustrated, alienated, or distrubed.

In fact they may be more socially attuned. 

## Oct 31

The mere existence of strain in the system does not necessarily cause social activisim.

Americans greatly underestimate the magnitude of wealth inequality. Recruited a sample of participants - representative of population as a whole, surveyed to ask them what the distribution of wealth was, and what they thought it should be. Compared to actual distribution, heavier concentration of wealth in upper tax bracket than americans thought. Residual potential for them to perceive some need for change (estimated -> ideal) and moreover when you break it down, there is widespread consensus among many varying groups. 

Two ways to explain the lack of social activism:

1. Americans underestimate how bad the situation is (but not sufficient to explain because still a gap between perceived and ideal)
2. Mere perception of inequality is not enough, because how you explain/interpret the problem frames how we handle it. If it's framed as problematic, more likely to demand more action.

-
Social psychological accoutnts of construction of grievances

Actual system strain or unjust conditions are insufficient to produce grievances.

Actual conditions need to be subjectively interpreted as problematic to be experienced as grievances.

Much of the work in social activism involves framing the grievances as problematic.

There are different ways of framing grievances:

- social relative deprivation (upwards comparisons to higher status groups)
- temporal relative deprivation (upwards cmparisons to present/past conditions)
- distributive justice grievances (inequity in resource allocation)
- procedural justice grievances (construing the system as unresponsive to one's needs or perspectives)

-
Framing and "cognitive liberation"

The emergence of a protest movement entails a transformation both of consciousness and behaviour. 

1. Diagnostic framing: identifying conditions as problematic and attributing problems to specific causes. Answers the questions: "what's wrong? Who's to blame?" Eg. Trump blaming Muslims
2. Prognostic framing: outlining an agenda for how the identified problem can be remedied (answers the question: What is to be done?")
3. Motivational framing - mobilizing frame supporters into action and sustaining their motivation in the face of obstacles (Answers the question "why me?"). Eg sucicide bombers - "the ruling to kill Americans and their allies is an individual duty for every muslim who can do it"

-
Loss aversion (eg. loss if you don't take action) has a stronger affect than gaining something positive. 

There is an asymmetry in how we respond to gains vs losses. A loss has greater psychic impact than a foregone gain of the same magnitude. 

Imagine there is a new tax policy that the gov't is implementing, more support for families with children. Redirect some resources to families with children. Frame in two ways:

1. Childless surchage (loss) frame: no children pays a surcharge of $X
2. Child bonus (gain) frame: gets bonus of $X 

More unfairness rating when cost to non-parents, fine when bonus to parents (neutral). 

-
Most easy to mobilize is the NIMBY social movement (not in my backyard, eg. wind farm near residential community, or waste disposal center, or homeless shelters). Emphasized threatened losses and disruptions to the community. "Everyone thought we couldn't fight the salvation army because it is good. But you can make anything look bad."

Salvation army's counter framing: redirected attention away from homeless men to homeless women and children who would be served by the shelter.

Goals of progressive movements often involve threatening to disrupt the quotidian. Also protest actions themselves often directly disrupt routines in order to draw attention to social problems (eg. sit ins, boycotts)

Paradox: disrupting the status quo evoked epistemic and existential threats that usually motivate people to defent the system. Thus progressive movements are inclined to provoke a reactionary public backlash. 

For radicals, need to frame protest to avoid provoking reactionary backlash. Eg. Toronto G20 protests. 

## Nov 2

Protest actions are inherently disruptive, causes a paradox: disrupting the status quo makes meople motivated to maintain the status quo.

G20 in toronto: movement/actisim against it, issues related to globalization, weath inequality, environnmental issues. Lots of police on streets to control the activism. Peaceful protests for the most part (and initially) but some more radicallized elements (black bloc). Broke away from the main march and engaged in vandalism, overturned police cars, set cars on fire. Police response to this was aggressive crackdown. 1000 people arrested during protests. Media commentary about disruption of order rather than ideological/political goes. Problem for activist movements that use similar tactics. Media critics don't focus on substantive political goals and more on social disruption and need for law and order.

Protests have this risk for inspiring backlash against their goals and rally around the system. 

-
Experiment.

Measured right wing authoritarianism (RWA) before and after story about imagined event in future Canada. Read 1/3 scenarios.

RWA measures submission to authorities, etc. 

Control, violent left-wing protests (First nation activist, unemployed labourers), violent right-wing protests (suppress leftists, overthrow Canadian gov't)

Exposure to any type of protest makes people more support of RWA attidues. (Even if right wing protest, but especially for left wing protests)

How can protesters avoid this?

Example: SCLC framing tactics:

Garner sympathy from media through culturally resonant framing:

- unique blend of Christian theology, democratic theory, and Gandhian philosophy of nonviolence
- staging highly symbolic confrontations between good and evil by goading racist Southern officials to respond with ugly acts of repression
  - failed in Ablany, GA. Choose Birmingham, Alabama next to campaign for desegregation. The commisioner of public safety could be countet on to respond violently. Police response got ugly, lost favour with the public. Protestors also recruited children, images of police confronting and physically coercing children did not look good. 

Gallup polling showed that the protests worked. 

Effective when protestors appear non violent, and system appears violent and coercive. 

-
Repeated previous study, where authorities were violent in response.  (violent left wing, nonviolent left wing, nonviolent left wing with gov't repression).

condition 1 -> more opposition

condition 2 -> also more RWA

condition 3 -> RWA blunted. 

Thus social movements need to be very disciplined to be effective. 

-
Channel factor: a stimulus or a response pathway that serves to elicit or sustain behavioural intentions with particular intensity and stability.

Need people to feel individually responsible. 

-
Social network ties as channel factors in high-cost activism. 

Organized by SNCC to recruit college students to register black voters.

961 applications to volounteer, 720 actually participated. 

Studied application files of participants and no-shows to determine what factors differentiated these groups. 

Coded personal determinants in essays.

Situational channeling factors (measured differences in social ties)

-
Movement called freedom summer. 

White and black people travelling in car together (illegal at the time). Stopped by police/someone, kidnapped. Were missing for many days, investigation to find out what happened that involved FBI. Eventually found brutally murdered, were lynched. At the start of the campaign, high costs visible to participants. 

-
Looked for internal factors and political attitudes. 

Both participants and no-shows were about the same in terms of personal attitudes (left leaning values).

In personal essays, both participants and no-shows had similar self-oriented motives. Paritipants however had more other-oriented motives. 

Participant essays were also twice as long as no shows. May have been strength of motivation differences.

Situational factors had more effect. Participants more than twice as likely to have tie with the same protest movement. May help to overcome fear (because the campaign was scary, possible consequence). Having someone else you trust may be a security blanket. Also fear of embarassment  of backing out.

## Nov 4

Survey to decide what's happeneing in people's lives after the protests (freedom summer). Measure before and after freedom summer.

After, the participants leaned left way more than the no shows. Remained more inolved in activist causes. People who went to freedom summer were radicalized. 

Sustained motivation that made them increasingly more divergent from the now show group. Identified less as "leftist". 

May be reducing cognitive dissonance by saying that this is more a part of their life to rationalize the costs of the efforts. Ideologically bolstered their committment to the cause. Might be more polarized because of exposure to like minded people. Might also been have more predisposed initially to social activism (though not measured initially). May have become part of an ingroup.

Emotional dynamics of social movements

Case study of emotion reappraisal work in social movements: AIDS activism

Very effective social activist movement. Emphasized patients rights, among other things. 

Early in the AIDS epidemic (1980s) dominant emotions included a mix of 

- negative emotions: fear, sadness about loss, anxiety about hieghtening anti gay strigma, shame about sexual practices (were being vilified)
- positive emotions: pride in gay communtity's responsible actions in providing services and care to AIDS victims
- minimal expression of anger about the system's response to AIDS crisis

Researcher coded for these.

in 1986, supreme court chose to uphold a law in Georgia that criminalized gay sex. A person was arrested for having gay sex in his own home. Challenged the arrest on constitutional grounds, supreme court upheld the law. In their support, linked homosexuality with beastility, other non normative sex acts, justified their ruling. The ruling had nothing explicitly to do with AIDS, but provided a moral shock to the gay community. Made some people feel that they had nothing left to lose. 

Gays were angry with the system, more expressions of anger, antagonism with the community, coming from the other side. 

ACT UP started advocating for AIDS-related activism. Had to stimulate emotional reappraisal within the community. Cultivated a sense of anger with the system, worked to transform feelings of sadness/shame to more policially useful feelings of anger and righteous indignation. 

- previously: AIDS death attributed to either personal deviance which evoked feelings of shame or a deadly virus that evoked fear or sadness
- ACT UP shifted attributions for AIDS deaths to gov't neglect which evokes anger and outrage

Some examples:

"the gov't has blood on its hands. one aids death every half hour"

In some protests played dead, gravestones, saying they were killed by the FDA, the gov't, etc.

Reframed to transform sadness into anger.

AIDS memorial quilt that grew out of the movement. Add a panel for each victim, guickly grew. 

Quilt initially focused just on grief, but ACT UP transformed it to anger:

"Show your anger to the people who helped make the quilt possible: our government"

Reframe for more politically useful emotion: anger.

Quilt makes the "death beautiful", want to make the deaths ugly again for political activism. Showed the reality of it, spread ashes on the white house lawn. Mobilize community of grief to a stance of anger. (political funeral)

Also transform shame into shaming of the system. Shamed president and the gov't that he represented. Other people were also similarly shamed. 

## Nov 7

Themes of authoritarianism:

Seeing the leader as the embodiment of the will of the masses. "I alone can fix this"

Emphasis on law and order.

Coercive assertion of power from a strong leader. 

Survey of americans asked about models of leadership. Would it be a good/bad idea "to have a strong leader who does not have to bother with congress and elections?"

College graduates said it was a bad idea much more. Much more of non college graduates thought it was a good idea. 

Most of Trump's supporters are less educated voters. 

It's not just Trump. Authoritarian models are getting more traction. Eg Putin, also western european leaders. Also Phillippines. Voters are more drawn to authoritarian models of politics. 

Before republican primaries conducted national survey of likely republican voters to see their preferences, and what were the predictors. Eg: what do you think are important traits for children to have?

Respuctful, obedient, well-behaved, well-mannered preferences correlated with authoritarian values. (vs curiousity and independence)

The more people endorsed RWA values, the more they preferred Trump.

After WW2, there was an interest in trying to understand why people supported RWA attitudes. A lot of the thoughts at the time were influenced by Freud.

Proposed a model that applied psychodynamic thoery to a propensity to joining facsist movements.

Say rooted in pent up frustration and aggressive tendencies. Growing up in a home when punished and contorl exerted upon you. Fosters a desire to aggress against the control. However we usally repress these emotions. According to Freud, it builds up and will eventually need some kind of outlet. The way we express and vent is through alternative channels. People with aggressive tendencies are pulled towards movements with cruel policies towards minority groups. Prejudice to just about all minority groups. Called this generalized ethno-centrism. Intolerence of ambiguity. Pattern of lashing out against weaker groups as a result of family dynamics. 

Willing to give a lot of power to strong leaders like Trump.

Study authoritarian aggression surveys (eg. smash perversion eating away at our moral fibers), also conventionalism. 

30 items tapping into all dynamics. Reliable and valid measure for RWA. RWA scale highly validated. 

To measure: had students imagine a situation where gov't told them that vigalinte-ism was okay. Eg. cracking down on radicals in society. 

Correlations with RWA range from .42 and .61. Not just in the context of radicals, other groups as well, such as homosexuals, abortion providers, religious cults, and even other RWAs (paradoxical).

Eg. trump told his supporters to beat up protestors in their midst.

-
Recruited university students to be either teacher or learner, similar to Milgram experiment. Every time learner made error, teacher was instructed to a shock to learner. Teacher chose the level of shock to give the learner. 

RWAs selected significatly higher shocks. Average was 2.4/5 but RWA was higher. Authority gave them license to commit aggression. 

-
cognitive biases of high RWAs

theory that people high in RWA have done less critical thinking because they usually defer to authority. So the yshould be poor critical consumers of information. May explain why they are susceptible to conspiracy theories, simplistic slogans. 

Gave people a long list of statements, some were contradictory. 

People high in RWA were more likely to endorse contradictory statements. 

Low RWAs more likely to disagree with both (may be logically legitimate). 

-
Bullshit receptivity scale - participants rated the profundity of a series of statements that are syntactically correct and seem meaningful but are actually vacuous. Eg. Hidden meaning transforms unparalleled abstract beauty vs control: a wet person does not fear the rain.

Correlated support with BS statements and support for different presidential candidates. 

Clinton - not much correlation.

Sanders - similarly low.

Trump - significant correlation. 

-
Double standards

How would you react to a law mandating religion in schools?

Then same problem in terms of an Islamic society (previous were christian). 

High RWA people were more likely to support christianity in schools, and didnt support islam.

Authoritarianism is rooted in the perception that the world is a dangerous place

## Nov 9

Trump sees himself as the voice of a disenfranchised group. Authoritarian submission, aggression. 

Authoritarianism is rooted in the perception that the world is a dangerous place. 

RWAs more alarmist, more likely to see things as out of control. More commonly see "destruction of family" as the most serious problem. Low RWAs choose environmental issues. 

RWAs are more concerned about everyting in general. Low RWAs have less endorsement in general, except environmental issues.

-
Study 

New Zealand participants read about and vividly imagined 1 of 3 future scenarios.

- thread condition: 8 years of economic decline, social disintegration
- secure condition: economic boon, crime decreases
- control: unchanged

DV: authoritarianism

Hypotheses: social thread should increase RWA. BDW scores should mediate the effect

Result: Threat condition predicts greater endorment that the word is a dangrous and chaotic place, shifts more likely to support RWA. (BDW = belief in a dangerous world)

Making people the world is in a bad place leads to RWA. Can see this in Trump's rhetoric. 

-
Not just existential threats, cultural threats as well. 

Study:

participants high or low in RWA read about an immigrant who either intended to assimilate or did not intend to do so to Swiss culture.

Measured RWA

IV: assimilitaion vs no assimilation condition

DV: Immigrant persecution measure (based on posse/vigilante measure)

Result:

- non-assimilation condition: significant association betwen RWA and immigrant persecution
- assimiliation condition: no significant correlation between variables. RWAs aren't always anti-immigrant, only when there's a threat

-
Global change game: what happens when RWAs rule the world?

50-70 participants role-play international decision makers dealing with environmental and economic crises and international conflicts. 

Participants assigned to nation states on a map with unequal distribution of resources within and between nations. 

Some play the role of elites and others represent non elites.

As game progresses, nations experience pop growth, job growth, deaths due to famine, disease, war etc

Deaths are symbolized by wearing armbands

Elites have the option of hoarding resources, nations can decide to form alliances with each other or engage in warfare.

Elites have options that non elites don't. 

Low RWA: no wars, threats of war, armies decreased nation wide (demilitarizition). Scheduled global summits, international coordination, environamental emission controls. As third world problems mounted, Europe intervened but North america ignored. Indian refugees not accepted when they needed help. 400 million total casualties. Global pop to 8.7 billion, and food and jobs to all. Through sustainable economics, demilitarization. Not a global utopia, there were problem, but on the whole, managed pretty well.

High RWA: superpowers kept nukes, middle east doubled oil prices, North America invaded, retaliated with nuclear force, destroyed all life. 

2nd chance: Serious crises, elites hoarded resources, 1.7 billion died from starvation, disease. 

RWA tends to spread, contagion. Trend that is increasing. RWA are less critical consumers of information.
